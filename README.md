## IDEAS:

### UI:

- allow moving recipes to different floors
  - must have all dependent recipes on that floor or earlier
  - how to do for codependent recipes like recycled plastic/rubber? move others/cascade checkbox?

- show belt tier for ingredients/products into building
  - option to enable in bar
  - probably easiest to show how many buildings fit tier 1, then 2, then 3, etc
    - use a segment kind of display somehow?
  - show on hover for something? or static panel?

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).
