# Satisfactory Production Tracker

**Stop losing track of factory connections.**

Ever build a massive factory only to discover you're missing one crucial ingredient connection at the end?
This production tracker solves the problem that existing Satisfactory tools ignore: **tracking the links between your factories**, not just what you're building.

Unlike other production planners that focus on recipes and ratios, this tool visualizes your entire supply chain as an interconnected network.
See exactly where each input comes from and where each output goes - across multiple factory floors - so you never miss a connection again.

This project draws inspiration from [Satisfactory Tools](https://www.satisfactorytools.com/1.0/production) and [Satisfactory Production Planner](https://satisfactoryproductionplanner.com/).
